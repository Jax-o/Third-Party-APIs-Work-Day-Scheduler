##Description

This is a work-day planner in which the user is able to enter various tasks in the corresponding time slots. The time slots are color coded to display which time slot is in the past, present or future. When the user clicks on the save button, their tasks will be saved in the corresponding time slot and displayed even upon refresh of the page. The user is also able to change previous tasks entered in timeslots and the save button will save their new changes. This web API was created using third party libraries: Bootstrap, and jQuery. In addition this web API also contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the incorporation of local storage.
